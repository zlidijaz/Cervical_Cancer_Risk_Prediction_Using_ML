# Cervical Cancer Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning

This is a hands-on project from Coursera focused on building and training an XG-Boost classifier to predict whether a person has a risk of having cervical cancer.
The project also contains theory behind the XG-Boost classifier given in jupiter notebook.

The main learning points:
* Understand the theory and intuition behind XGBoost Algorithm
* Develop, train and evaluate XG-Boost classifier model using Scikit-Learn
* Preform exploratory data analysis using pandas and seaborn packages

In the repo, two jupiter notebooks are given.  
One represents only sceleton with given tasks and no solutions,suitable for anyone who wants to learn and practice python skills.  
The second notebook represents final solutions.
