# Cervical Cancer Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning

This is a hands-on project from Coursera focused on building and training an XG-Boost classifier to predict whether a person has a risk of having cervical cancer.
The project also contains theory behind the XG-Boost classifier given in jupiter notebook.

The main learning points:
* Understand the theory and intuition behind XGBoost Algorithm
* Develop, train and evaluate XG-Boost classifier model using Scikit-Learn
* Preform exploratory data analysis using pandas and seaborn packages

The repo contains two jupiter notebook and given data in csv format.  
One jupiter notebook is given as a skeleton (with given tasks and no solutions),  
suitable for anyone who wants to learn and practice python skills.    
The second notebook contains final solutions to all problems.
